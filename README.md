## Intro
Welcome to digital garden vault. The first idea and steps of this vault was based on [Belén Aldueza's GitHub vault](https://github.com/belen-albeza/obsidian-starter-vault). 

To start using this vault just download the whole folder and initialize Obsidian. A dialog to choose the vault will open so you just have to select `Open Folder as Vault` and select the downloaded root directory.

As I mentioned, this vault is strongly based on Belén vault for starters and therefore I'm dropping some of her sources here together with some [[👩‍🌾 Digital gardeners|others]]. I encourage you to go through it so you can understand the basis of digital gardening.
 [[🥚 The six patterns of gardening]]. 

## Customization

After a little reading, you can go with some awesome customization, Obsidian has a massive amount of [[🔌 Plugins]] you can try. Also you can check Obsidian > Preferences > Appearance > Themes to customize the editor appearance.

## Using tips

 - Obsidian language is [markdown](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Basic+formatting+syntax) check the linked official site.
 - There are two folders: **🌱 Seedling** and **🌳 Forest** which main purpose is to store knowledge, on an eraly step when you're just gathering info it can go on **🌱 Seedling** and when is more linked and well formed (no need to be **finished**) it can be moved to **🌳 Forest**.
 - Every list you create with checkboxes on a note tagged with  #todo-list, will be showed on [[⏰ ToDo Lists]] note, this is done thanks to [dataview plugin](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview).
	 - [ ] To do example
 - To open the daily note: Go to the left pane and click on ![[dailyicon.png]] icon. If you don't like the template, just go to `Templates > Daily Note` and change whatever you consider.
- To check your knowledge graph, goto the left pane and click on ![[knowledgeGraphIcon.png]] `Open graph view`. The graph view will show something similar to:
  ![[graphView.png]]
